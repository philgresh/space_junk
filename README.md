## Space Junk Eliminator! ##
This [JavaScript game](https://philgresh.github.io/space_junk/) takes inspiration from an [article I read](https://www.space.com/24895-space-junk-wild-clean-up-concepts.html) discussing propositions to clear the nearby space of debris from launches and dead satellites.

### Storyline
Humans have successfully, but recklessly, colonized Mars. There is now so much space junk floating around the planet that it will soon become impossible to receive any resupplies!

Defend your homeworld using the newest Martian technology!

### Gameplay
Players can cycle between 3 technologies to destroy space junk circling around the planet:
* Laser - Weak, does not affect larger pieces of junk, but mashing the trigger might blow out all the smaller debris in an area.
* Static discharge - Clears everything within its discharge radius (and makes a cool lightning effect too).
* Hyperkinetic cannonballs - Like your great-great-x7-grandfather used to launch.

Players rack up points for destroying debris and lose points for debris that hits the planet.

### Room for improvement
- [ ] The lasers and cannonballs don't seem to break anything up or destroy them
- [ ] The static discharge is *too* powerful. May introduce a "charging" limitation (can only fire after fully charged, say 10s?)
- [ ] The quantity and attributes of debris are tunable and can use some attention
- [ ] Styling could be better than solid-color rectangles. Let's throw some oblongs in there!
